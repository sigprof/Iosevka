        # Cosevka Basic is a font family with only the regular and bold
        # weights, only the normal (upright) and italic slopes (the slanted
        # variant is not present), and only the normal width (other widths for
        # Cosevka Basic are provided as separate families, so that they would
        # be accessible from software which cannot specify the “width”
        # attribute when selecting fonts).  In addition, there are no
        # ligatures, and all characters have the same width.  These
        # restrictions make the Cosevka Basic family usable with software that
        # requires strictly monospace fonts and does not support modern font
        # selection methods or advanced text rendering.
        #
        # This font family is also used as a base for all other families
        # defined here; in particular, the character variant configuration set
        # here is inherited by all other fonts.

        # Cosevka Basic Semi-Wide is a wider version of Cosevka Basic (15%
        # wider than the normal version, which matches the Iosevka Extended
        # width in 5.x versions).  The font properties are set to pretend that
        # the font has “normal” width to avoid confusing software which does
        # not support font widths properly.
        #
        # The unusual “Semi-Wide” name is used instead of “Semi-Extended” or
        # “Semi-Expanded” to avoid troubles with some software (e.g., Pango)
        # that may handle these words at the end of font name in a special way
        # (Pango would treat “Semi-Expanded” as a width attribute, unless a
        # comma is added after the font family name, but sometimes other
        # software on top of Pango has problems with commas in font names).
        #
        # Note that the name of the `widths` subkey must correspond to the
        # actual font width (i.e., it should not be `normal`, unlike the
        # example that Iosevka Customizer suggests), because this name is used
        # to create the TTF filename suffix, which is later used to combine
        # fonts with similar suffixes into a single TTC for glyph unification
        # and hinting.  Setting the `widths` subkey to `normal` would break
        # glyph unification with other fonts which actually have the same
        # width, resulting in a larger TTC file.  The TTF filename suffix is
        # modified later in the Makefile wrapper for the Iosevka build system,
        # so the released font files do not get repeated width designation in
        # filenames.
